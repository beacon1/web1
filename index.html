<p>what we can see on the page</p>
<p>and what you can't see on the page</p>
The HTML < link > Element<br>
The <link> element is used to link to <strong>external style sheets:</strong><br>
< link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyles.css" ><br>
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an <em>entire</em> web site, by changing one file!</P>

<p>This is designing the colours like above HTML in the HEAD tagname so your design style is seperate from your main HTML</p>

<h2>An internal CSS has defined the colours, in the < head > section of this HTML page, within the < style > element.</h2></p>
<p style="color:red;">This is an <strong>inline</strong> CSS</p>
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.<br>

Here is how the "styles.css" looks (see test:html for exact setup):<bR>
body {
    background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
    color: blue;
font-family: courier;
    font-size: 300%;
}
p {
    color: red;font-family: courier;
    font-size: 160%;
}
</p>
<p>you can change font size, colour & family. Alter colours by Class or by ID. Add Borders, padding & margins all in your Cascading Style Sheet.
